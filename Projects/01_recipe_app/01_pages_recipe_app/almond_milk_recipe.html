		<h4>HOW TO MAKE A BASIC Almond MILK</h4>
		<b>
			<ol>
				<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
				<li>
					Combine raw almonds with enough water to cover the almonds by at least
					three inches.
				</li>
				<li>Let stand overnight.</li>
				<li>
					The next day, strain the almonds and discard the soaking water. Then
					transfer to a high-speed blender with the 4 cups of filtered water and
					a pinch of salt.
				</li>
				<li>
					Blend until smooth and well blended, about 1 minute. Be careful not to
					run the blender or food processor too long as this will heat the milk.
				</li>
				<li>
					If more blending is required, stop, wait, for milk to cool, and then
					blend again.
				</li>
				<li>
					Strain the milk through a nut milk bag, paper coffee filter, or a
					clean and thin dish towel.
				</li>
				<li>
					Pour the almond milk into a bottle, seal, and place in the coldest
					place in your refrigerator for up to 7 days.
				</li>
			</ol>

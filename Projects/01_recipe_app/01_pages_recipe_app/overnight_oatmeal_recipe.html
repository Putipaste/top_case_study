		<h3>BASE INGREDIENTS YOU NEED TO MAKE OVERNIGHT OATS</h3>
		<p>
			You only need two ingredients to make overnight oats, which are, of
			course, milk and oats. But it probably won’t taste very good, and by
			adding in Greek yogurt, chia seeds, and a drizzle of your favorite
			sweetener, you’re really creating a well-rounded breakfast.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Oats:</b> This is really the only ingredient that’s non-negotiable.
				Make sure to use plain old-fashioned oats and not quick oats because the
				consistency is best with rolled oats. You can also use gluten-free oats.
				Do not use steel cut oats.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Milk:</b> For the liquid part, you can actually make this with water!
				But it’s more common to use milk. You can use full fat, 2% or low-fat
				milk. You can also use plant-based milk like
				<a href="./almond_milk_recipe.html">almond milk</a>, coconut milk,
				cashew milk or <a href="./oat_milk_recipe.html">oat milk</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Chia seeds (optional):</b> These seeds are packed with tons of
				nutrition, and they help give the oats a pudding-like texture. So I
				always like to include them in my base recipe.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Greek or vegan yogurt (optional):</b> This gives the oats a tangy
				flavor, creamy texture and boost of protein.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Vanilla extract (optional):</b> This enhances all the flavors that go
				into the overnight oatmeal as well as giving it sweetness without any
				sweetener.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Sweetener (optional):</b> Use honey or maple syrup to sweeten the
				mixture, especially because oats can be somewhat bland on their own.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Toppings:</b> This is where you can have some fun with fresh fruit,
				dried fruit, nut butters, nuts, seeds and spices (like cinnamon, nutmeg
				or cardamom). There are so many topping ideas and combinations, and I
				think that’s what makes this such a great versatile recipe!
